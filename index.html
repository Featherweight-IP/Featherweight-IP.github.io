<h1>Featherweight IP</h1>
  Design IP often comes with features that most users will never use. How many times have you configured a UART in 5-bit mode? 
  In larger designs, the resources consumed by these unused features are really in the noise. In a resource-constrained environment,
  such as small FPGAs, eliminating these unused features makes all the difference!
  <p/>
  Featherweight IP is a collection of resource- and feature-constrained IP that aims to provide a excellent options in
  resource-constrained environments.
